                <h3>Ajax</h3>
                <ul class="notes list">
                    <li>It's a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server, and it
                        dynamically updates web pages without reloading. This enables data to be sent and received in
                        the background, as well as portions of a page to be updated in response to user events, while
                        the rest of the program continues to run.</li>
                    <li>A client, such as a web browser, will request a resource (usually a web page) from a server,
                        which processes the request and sends back a response to the client. Ajax allows JavaScript to
                        request resources from a server on behalf of the client. </li>
                    <li>A server is required when requesting resources using Ajax. Typically this involves using a
                        server-side language, such as PHP, Ruby, Node.js, or .NET to serve the data response following
                        an Ajax request (usually from a back-end database).</li>
                    <li>Ajax was a neat acronym that referred to the different parts of the process being used:
                        Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.</li>
                    <li>APIs: An application programming interface (API) is a collection of methods that allows external
                        access to another program or service. This means that developers are able to interact with the
                        data and create mashups of third-party services.</li>
                    <li>Fetch API: The Fetch API provides a global <span class="code">fetch()</span> method that only
                        has one mandatory argument, which is the URL of the resource you wish to fetch. For example:
                        <br>
                        <span class="code">
                            fetch('https://example.com/data') <br>
                            .then( // code that handles the response ) <br>
                            .catch( // code that runs if the server returns an error )</span> <br>
                        In the example above, the promise will be resolved when a response is received from the URL
                        'https:example.com/data'. Because it's a promise, we can also use a <span
                            class="code">catch</span> statement at the end to deal with any errors that may occur.
                    </li>
                    <li>The <span class="code">redirect()</span> method can be used to redirect to another URL. It
                        creates a new promise that resolves to the response from the redirected URL. <br>
                        Here is an example of how a redirect response promise would be resolved:
                        <span class="code">
                            fetch(url) <br>
                            .then( response => response.redirect(newURL)); // redirects to
                            another URL <br>
                            .then( // do something else ) <br>
                            .catch( error => console.log('There was an error: ',
                            error))</span> <br>
                            At the present time, there is no support for the redirect() method in any browser.
                    </li>
                    <li>The <span class="code">text()</span> method takes a stream of text from the response, reads it to completion and then returns a promise that resolves to a USVSting object that can be treated as a string in JavaScript.</li>
                    <li>The <span class="code">blob()</span> method is used to read a file of raw data, such as an image or a spreadsheet.</li>
                    <li>The <span class="code">json()</span> method is used to deal with these by transforming a stream of JSON data into a promise that resolves to a JavaScript object.</li>
                    <li>The Fetch API introduced a <span class="code">Headers</span>interface, which can be used to create a Headers object, which can then be added as a property of Request and Response objects.</li>
                    <li>We can also use Ajax to send information. This can be a variety of formats, but is usually a JSON string.</li>
                    <li>The Fetch API includes the <span class="code">FormData</span> interface, which makes it much easier to submit information in forms using Ajax. <br>
                    A <span class="code">FormData</span> instance is created using a constructor function: <br> <span class="code">const data = new FormData();</span></li>
                    <li>The jQuery library is a good option - it has the generic <span class="code">ajax()</span> method that can be used in a very similar way to the <span class="code">fetch()</span> method.</li>

                    <h3>The Window Object</h3>
                    <ul class="notes list">
                        <li>Every JavaScript environment has a global object. Any variables that are created in the
                            global scope are actually properties of this object, and any functions are methods of it. In
                            browser environment, the global object is the <span class="code">window</span> object, which
                            represents the browser window that contains a web page.</li>
                        <li>The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and methods that
                            contain information about the browser and computer screen.</li>
                        <li>BOM only makes sense in a browser environment.</li>
                        <li>This means that other environments (such as Node.js) probably won't have a <span
                                class="code">window</span> object, although they will still have a global object; for
                            example, Node.js has an object called <span class="code">global</span>.</li>
                        <li>The <span class="code">window.location</span> property is an object that contains
                            information about the URL of the current page. For example: <span class="code">href,
                                protocol, host, hostname, port, pathname and more.</span></li>
                        <li>A new window can be opened using the <span>window.open()</span> method. This can also be
                            assigned to a variable, so the window can then be referenced later in the code:
                            <p class="code">const popup =
                                window.open('https://sitepoint.com','SitePoint','width=400,height=400,resizable=yes');
                            </p>
                            <p>Don't forget: <span class="code">close() | moveTo() | resizeTo()</span></p>
                        </li>
                        <li>The <span class="code">window.screen</span> object contains information about the screen the
                            browser is displayed on.
                            <p>Properties: <span class="code">height, width, availHeight, availWidth, colorDepth</span>
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Each <span class="code">window </span>window object contains a <span
                                class="code">document</span> object. This object has properties and methods that deal
                            with the page that has been loaded into the window.</li>
                        <li>Cookies are small files that are saved locally on a user's computer. Cookies can be used to
                            store information that can then be retrieved between requests. Cookies are also limited to
                            storing up to 4KB of data, although 20 cookies are allowed per domain, which can add up to
                            quite a lot of data.</li>
                        <li>Cookies take the form of a text file that contain a list of name/value pairs separated by
                            semicolons. For example, a cookie file might contain the following information:
                            <p class="code">"name=Superman; hero=true; city=Metropolis"</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Timing Functions:
                            <p><span class="code">setTimeout()</span> :Accepts a callback to a function as its first
                                parameter and a number of milliseconds as its second parameter. Try entering the
                                following example into a console. It should show an alert dialog after three seconds
                                (that's 3000 milliseconds):</p>
                            <p class="code">window.setTimeout( () => alert("Time's Up!"), 3000);<< 4</p>
                                    <p><span class="code">setInterval()</span> :Works in a similar way to
                                        <span>window.setTimeout()</span>, except that it will repeatedly invoke the
                                        callback function after every given number of milliseconds. <br>
                                        The previous example used an anonymous function, but it is also possible to use
                                        a named function like so:</p>
                                    <p class="code">function chant(){ console.log('Beetlejuice'); }</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>The <span class="code">setTimeOut()</span> and <span class="code">setInterval()</span>
                            methods can be used to animate elements on a web page. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>MDN The Content Template Element</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <span class="code">&lt;template&gt;</span> HTML element is a mechanism for holding HTML
                            that is not to be rendered immediately when a page is loaded but may be instantiated
                            subsequently during runtime using JavaScript.
                            <p>The only standard attributes that the template element supports are the global
                                attributes.</p>
                            <p>A <span class="code">DocumentFragment</span> is not a valid target for various events, as
                                such it is often preferable to clone or refer to the elements within it. Example:</p>
                            <p>HTML <br><span class="code">&lt;div id="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;template
                                    id="template"&gt;&lt;div&gt;Click me&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/template&gt;</span></p>
                            <p>JavaScript <br><span class="code">
                                    const container = document.getElementById("container");<br>
                                    const template = document.getElementById("template");<br>
                                    <br>
                                    function clickHandler(event) {<br>
                                    event.target.append(" — Clicked this div");<br>
                                    } <br>
                                    <br>
                                    const firstClone = template.content.cloneNode(true);<br>
                                    firstClone.addEventListener("click", clickHandler);<br>
                                    container.appendChild(firstClone);<br>
                                    <br>
                                    const secondClone = template.content.firstElementChild.cloneNode(true);<br>
                                    secondClone.addEventListener("click", clickHandler);<br>
                                    container.appendChild(secondClone);</span></p>

                            <p>Result <br><span class="code">firstClone</span> is a DocumentFragment instance, so while
                                it gets appended inside the container as expected, clicking on it does not trigger the
                                click event. <span class="code">secondClone</span> is an HTMLDivElement instance,
                                clicking on it works as one would expect.</p>

                    <h2>Notes PART II</h2>
                    <h3>Testing and Debugging</h3>
                    <ul class="notes list">
                        <li>Errors and bugs are a fact of life in programming ― they will always be there. A ninja
                            programmer will try to do everything to minimize errors occurring, and find ways to identify
                            and deal with them quickly.</li>
                        <li>They are usually caused by one of the following:
                            <br> - System error ― there's a problem with the system or external devices with which the
                            program is interacting.
                            <br> - Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could
                            even be as simple as a typo.
                            <br> - User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to
                            handle.
                        </li>
                        <li>An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program
                            to deal with the error. For example: <br>
                            <span class="code">unicorn();<< ReferenceError: unicorn is not defined</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>A warning can occur if there's an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program
                            to crash. This means the program will continue to run after a warning. This might sound
                            good, but it can be problematic, since the issue that produced the warning may cause the
                            program to continue running incorrectly. Example: <br>
                            <span class="code">pi = 3.142;<< JavaScript Warning: assignment to undeclared
                                    variable</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>Debugging is the process of finding out where bugs occur in the code and then dealing with
                            them. In many cases, the point at which an error occurs is not always where it originated,
                            so you'll need to run through the program to see what's happening at different stages of its
                            execution. </li>
                        <li>One of the most useful commands is the <span class="code">debugger</span> keyword. This will
                            create a breakpoint in your code that will pause the execution of the code and allow you to
                            see where the program is currently up to. </li>
                        <li>The example below shows how the<span class="code">debugger</span> command can be used in the
                            <span class="code">amIOldEnough()</span> function. If you try entering the code below into
                            your browser's console, then invoke the<span class="code">amIOldEnough()</span> function,
                            the browser's debugging tool will automatically kick in and you'll be able see the value of
                            the <span class="code">age</span> variable by hovering over it:

                    <h3>How Single-Page Applications Work</h3>
                    <ul class="notes list">
                        <li>A single-page application (SPA) is a website that re-renders its content in response to
                            navigation actions (e.g. clicking a link) without making a request to the server to fetch
                            new HTML.</li>
                        <li>An internal state SPA can only load the app's entry. <br> A location-based SPA render can
                            immediately render the desired content</li>
                        <li>While the URL in the address bar is what users see and interact with, SPAs use <span
                                class="code">window.location</span>. This allows you to interact with the different
                            parts of the URL without having to parse it yourself. The <span
                                class="code">window.location</span> properties map directly from the URL</li>
                        <li>Instead of creating a new <span class="code">Document</span> for every location, the History
                            API re-uses the active<span class="code">Document</span> by updating it to reflect the new
                            location. <br>The History API has three core functions: <span
                                class="code">pushState()</span>, <span class="code">replaceState()</span>, and <span
                                class="code">go()</span>. These (and the rest of the API) are accessed via <span
                                class="code">window.history</span>.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>The HTML5 Template Element</h3>
                    <ul class="notes list">
                        <li>It provides an easy way to define a reusable fragment of HTML that can be manipulated just
                            like you would the contents of the document itself, but without the overhead of actually
                            updating the DOM or having to compile and parse strings of HTML.</li>
                        <li>Anything inside of a <span class="code">&lt;template&gt;</span> tag gets parsed just like
                            regular HTML, except: <br>
                            - It doesn't get rendered. <br>
                            - `&lt;script&gt;`tags inside of it don't get run. <br>
                            - `&lt;style&gt;` tags inside of it don't get evaluated. <br>
                            - It doesn't load any external resources (so you won't see any requests for the contents of

                    <h3>Further Functions</h3>
                    <ul class="notes list">
                        <li>The fact that functions are first-class objects means they can have properties and methods
                            themselves. For example, all functions have a <span class="code">length</span> property that
                            returns the number of parameters the function has.</li>
                        <li>We can create some objects that have a name property, then use the <span
                                class="code">call()</span> method to invoke the <span class="code">sayHello()</span>
                            function, providing each object as an argument. This will then take the value of <span
                                class="code">this</span> in the function: <br>
                            <span class="code">
                                function sayHello(){ <br>
                                <span style="padding-left: 30px;">return `Hello, my name is ${ this.name }`; </span>
                                <br>
                                } <br>
                                const clark = { name: 'Clark' }; <br>
                                const bruce = { name: 'Bruce' }; <br>
                                <br>
                                sayHello.call(clark); <br>
                                << 'Hello, my name is Clarke' <br>
                                    sayHello.call(bruce); <br>
                                    << 'Hello, my name is Bruce' </span>
                        </li>
                        <li>If a function doesn't refer to an object as this in its body, it can still be called using
                            the <span class="code">call()</span> method, but you need provide null as its first
                            argument.</li>
                        <li>The <span class="code">apply()</span> method works in the same way, except the arguments of
                            the function are provided as an array, even if there is only one argument.</li>
                        <li>We can add a <span class="code">description</span> property to a function that describes
                            what it does. A useful feature of this is that it provides result caching, or memoization.
                            If a function takes some time to compute a return value, we can save the result in a <span
                                class="code">cache</span> property.</li>
                        <li>An Immediately Invoked Function Expression - or IIFE - (pronounced 'iffy') is an anonymous
                            function that, as the name suggests, is invoked as soon as it's defined. </li>
                        <li>Placing any code that uses the temporary variable inside an IIFE will ensure it's only
                            available while the IIFE is invoked, then it will disappear.</li>
                        <li>An IIFE can be used to set up any initialization code that there'll be no need for again.
                            Because the code is only run once, there's no need to create any reusable, named functions,
                            and all the variables will also be temporary. Example: <br>
                            <code>
                                (function() { <br>
                                    const name = 'Peter Parker'; // This might be obtained from a cookie in reality <br>
                                    const days = ['Sunday','Monday','Tuesday','Wednesday','Thursday', 'Friday','Saturday']; <br>
                                    const date = new Date(),today = days[date.getDay()]; <br>
                                    console.log(`Welcome back ${name}. Today is ${today}`); <br>
                                })(); <br>
                                << 'Welcome back Peter Parker. Today is Tuesday'
                            </code>
                        </li>
                        <li>When trying to write a function that define and rewrite itself, we can lose properties.</li>
                        <li>A recursive function is one that invokes itself until a certain condition is met. It's a
                            useful tool to use when iterative processes are involved. Example: <br>
                            <code>
                            function factorial(n) { <br>
                               <span class="one_tab">if (n === 0) {</span>  <br>
                                   <span class="two_tabs">return 1;</span>  <br>
                                <span class="one_tab">} else {</span> <br>
                                    <span class="two_tabs">return n * factorial(n - 1);</span> <br>
                                <span class="one_tab">}</span> <br>
                            }
                        </code>
                        </li>
                        <li>Callback Hell is when more than one callback is used in the same function, resulting in a
                            large number of nested blocks that are difficult to comprehend.</li>
                        <li>A promise is created using a constructor function. This takes a function called an executor as an argument. The executor initializes the promise and starts the asynchronous operation. It also accepts two functions as arguments: the <span class="code">resolve()</span> function is called if the operation is successful, and the <span class="code">reject()</span> function is called if the operation fails: <br>
                            <code>
                            const promise = new Promise( (resolve, reject) => { <br>
                                <span class="one_tab">// initialization code goes here</span> <br>
                                <span class="one_tab">if (success) {</span> <br>
                                        <span class="two_tabs">resolve(value);</span> <br>
                                    <span class="one_tab">} else {</span>  <br>
                                        <span class="two_tabs">reject(error);</span> <br>
                                    <span class="one_tab">}</span> <br>
                            });
                        </code>
                        </li>
                        <li>A closure is a reference to a variable that was created inside the scope of another function, but is then kept alive and used in another part of the program.</li>
                        <li>Whenever a function is defined inside another function, the inner function will have access to any variables that are declared in the outer function's scope.</li>
                        <li>Any pure function must have: <br>
                            _At least one argument; otherwise the return value must depend on something other than the arguments of the function, breaking the first rule <br>
                            _A return value; otherwise there's no point in the function (unless it has changed something else in the program - in which case, it's broken the 'no side-effects' rule).
                        </li>
                        <li>By 'currying' a generic function, we can create a new, more specific function, that is simpler to use.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Transforms and Transitions</h3>
                    <ul class="notes list">
                        <li>The CSS3 <span class="code">transform</span> property lets you lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page.</li>
                        <li>We can apply translation, scaling, rotation and skew styles to almost every different element in our website. We can also choose the origin of the transform effect.</li>
                        <li>Animation has certainly been possible for some time with JavaScript, but native CSS transitions generally require less client-side processing, so they'll usually appear smoother. This is better for mobile users.</li>
                        <li>Transitions allow the values of CSS properties to change over time, essentially providing simple animations. We can animate any of the transforms we've used, so that our pages feel more dynamic.</li>
                        <li>Steps to create a simple transition using only CSS: <br>
                            Declare the original state of the element in the default style declaration. <br>
                            Declare the final state of your transitioned element; for example, a <span class="code">:hover</span> state. <br>
                            Include the transition functions in your default style declaration using the transition properties, including: <span class="code">transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay</span>. </li>
                        <li>The transition <span class="code">property</span> is shorthand for the four transition properties. Example: <br>
                        <code>
                            .ad-ad2 h1 span { <br>
                               <span class="one_tab">transition-property: transform; </span> <br>
                                <span class="one_tab">transition-duration: 0.2s;  </span> <br>
                                <span class="one_tab">transition-timing-function: ease-out;</span> <br>
                                <span class="one_tab">transition-delay: 50ms;</span> <br>
                            } <br>
                        </code>
                        Let's combine all those values into a shorthand declaration: <br>
                        <code>
                            .ad-ad2 h1 span { <br>
                                <span class="one_tab">transition: transform 0.2s ease-out 50ms;</span> <br>
                            }
                        </code>
                        </li>
                        <li>CSS animations, unlike transitions, allow you to control each step of an animation via keyframes.</li>
                        <li>For an animation called <span class="code">myAnimation</span>, the <span class="code">@keyframes</span> rule would look like this: <br>
                        <code>
                            @-webkit-keyframes myAnimation { <br>
                            <span class="one_tab">/* put animation keyframes here */</span> <br>
                            } <br>
                            @keyframes myAnimation { <br>
                            <span class="one_tab">/* put animation keyframes here */</span> <br>
                            } <br>
                        </code>
                        </li>
                        <li>Animation properties: <br>
                            <span class="code">
                                animation-name <br>
                                animation-duration <br>
                                animation-timing-function <br>
                                animation-iteration-count <br>
                                animation-direction <br>
                                animation-delay
                            </span></li>
                        <li>Example for shorthand animation property: <br>
                        <code>
                            .verbose { <br>
                                <span class="one_tab">animation-name: appearDisappear; </span> <br>

                    <ul class="notes list">
                        <li>JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.</li>
                        <li>JWTs can be signed using a secret (with HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA.</li>
                        <li>I should use it when: <br>
                            _Authentication: This is the typical scenario for using JWT, once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token. <br>
                            _Information Exchange: JWTs are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties, because as they can be signed, for example using a public/private key pair, you can be sure that the sender is who they say they are. </li>
                        <li>A JWT has a header, a payload and a signature. It typically looks like the following:   xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz</li>
                        <li>Example of a real JMT: <br>
                        <img src="images/example02.png" alt="JMT example"></li>
                        <li>Whenever the user wants to access a protected route, it should send the JWT, typically in the Authorization header using the Bearer schema. Therefore the content of the header should look like the following: <br>
                        <code>Authorization: Bearer &lt;token&gt;</code></li>
                    </ul>

                        <li>Javascritpt allowed us to create interactivity in the browser and become real developers on the front-end side.</li>
                        <li>We learned what the possibilities in Javascript are.</li>
                        <li>We work on faith because we hope the framework that we are using has all built-in.</li>
                        <li>Context switching is mentally exhausting. Rethinking tooling… prevent us from doing things wrong instead of patching up what we created.</li>
